            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a
            gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the
            average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is
            named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's
            sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than
            the 2nd century for the planet Saturn.

        <p>
            Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because
            hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius
            containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily
            toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.Standard planetary models suggest
            that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen
            and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.

            The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion
            of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of
            elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match
            the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements
            is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core
            region.

            Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and
            are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter.
            Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s.
            Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.
